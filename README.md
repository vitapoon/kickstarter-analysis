## Overview of Project
In this project we will handle thousand of data, and find out the campaign outcomes based on different factors. We filter and formate the data and use Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to predict outcomes based on launch date and goals. The tables are shown as below.

### Purposetal
We will be performaing data analysis on several thhousand crowdfunding project to uncover any hidden trends.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
-  Handing Enourmouse Data In Less Time:

When it comes to hadining enormous data, the task gets moore difficult.We need to use some excel functions to split the data of the application in small faragments.

-  Visual Representation of Data

We need to represent the data in an easy format that makes it readable and understandable, as a result, we can utilize different types of graphs or tables to represtnt the data.
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

According to the line chart above, we find out that for Theater, the successful cases kept increasing from March and reached the peak in May, then the number went down til December. 

The failed and canceled outcomes remaind stable, yet the failed number slightly went up and there was no canceled outcome in Octomber.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Overall, the failure rate increated with the goal inceased. The goal is less than 1000, the successful rate is the highest (almost 80%), and then decreased graduatly to 20% when the goal is up to $25000 to $29999, and the number of successful is 0 when the goal is up to $45000 to $49999.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could creat outcomes based on different catergaries.
